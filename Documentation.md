## Overview

To groom my skills in React & Javascript concepts, I pursue Sabka Bazaar use case with tech stack such as Webpack, React, React-Router, Sass etc. I have a created my own components from scratch to gain a better understanding of things under the hood.

- No External or Component Library used
- Custom webpack setup

## Roadmap

**Week 1**

- Atomic Design structure
- Basic webpack Configuration
- Learned Sass (Mixins, Variables, Nesting)
- BEM structure in Sass
- Header & Footer components

**Week 2**

- Created Atoms (Buttons, Images etc.)
- Created Section Component in Home Page

**Week 3**

- Card & Sidebar Component in Product Page
- BrowserRouter configuration for webpack & use in app
- Worked on SignIn & Register Pages

**Week 4**

- CartPage for Tablet & mobile
- Dropdown on product page for navigating
- Global State management using Context API (useContext/createContext hook)
- Created a cart modal for desktop

**Week 5**

- Carousel
- Swipe functionality in carousel for touchscreens
- Improvements in the UI & refactoring of the code
- Deployment on netlify

## Optimizations

What optimizations did I make in my code?

- Global Sass Variables & Mixins for reusability
- Created Custom hooks for reusable functions
- Global state management (Context Api)
- Implemeted DRY (Do not repeat yourself) principle
- Making site accessible using Semantic Html

## Features

- Cart Modal for Desktop
- Dropdown for mobile
- Swipe functionality in carousel for Touchscreens
- No scroll when using Cart Modal
- Focus Trap
- Use of title attribute (Tooltip) for text (Hover mouse over incomplete text)
- Autocompletion/suggestion off for forms
- Floating-labels
- Customized scrollbar for chrome/safari

## Lessons Learned

What are the learnings & challenges I faced while building this project?

- Why **semantic Html** is important?
- What is **Atomic design** structure & Why use them?
- Create Webpack from scratch
- React UI rendering Process
- **Accessibility**
- **HashRouter or BrowserRouter**. Which to Choose & configuration in webpack for both?
- Use of CSS Grid in Card Component
- **matchMedia()** method for mediaqueries in JS
- Why should we use Custom Hooks?
- Global State Management (Context API)
- **React Portal for Cart Modal**
- **Focus Trap** & why it is important?
- Floating-labels (Input + Label)
- **onTouch events**
- Deployment on netlify (_redirects file)
- Javascript concepts - ES6 & above (Optional Chaining, Template literals, Object.values etc.)

## Learning in Progress

- React Lazy-loading (Dynamic Import)
- Suspense
- Unit Testing (Jest & React Testing Library)
